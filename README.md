# Dark-themed Landing Page (only fullscreen)

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Project Description

This project was made by transforming AR Shakir's Figma Design into a full blown landing page, in React, for the purposes of getting to know Figma and constructing projects based on Figma designs. Since this design only came in a full (web) size, and no designs for mobile/tablets were available, I just focused on transforming that design into code, and I did not create responsive views (although it might be easy enough, by adding a few media quieries). But since this project is mostly for the purposes of familiarizing with Figma and the tranformation of it's design into code, I did not bother with that. Also, other projects on profile showcase responsive design..

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
