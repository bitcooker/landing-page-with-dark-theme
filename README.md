# Landing Page With Dark Theme

This project was made by transforming AR Shakir's Figma Design into a full blown landing page, in React, for the purposes of getting to know Figma and constructing projects based on Figma designs. Since this design only came in a full (web) size, and no designs for mobile/tablets were available, I just focused on transforming that design into code, and I did not create responsive views (although it might be easy enough, by adding a few media quieries). But since this project is mostly for the purposes of familiarizing with Figma and the tranformation of it's design into code, I did not bother with that. Also, other projects on profile showcase responsive design..

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm run build`

It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!
